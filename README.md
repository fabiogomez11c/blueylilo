This is just an example of YOLOv5 training with custom dataset (pet names). The dataset was obtained from the `mp4` file and taking frames randomnly to create the images. Annotated with CVAT (not included in this repo).

The dataset for training is in the folder `blueylilo`. The folder contains both images and annotations.

To train the model I used YOLOv5 tutorial from [this](https://docs.ultralytics.com/yolov5/train_custom_data/#local-logging) link. Also I checked the video tutorial in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFNJGim3FXw&t) link.
